Changelog
==========

Version *Next*
---------------

**Released**: TBD

**Features**

- Add Sakai support `(#1408)
  <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/1408>`__. Full LTI integration
  with Sakai.
- Add support for SSO `(#1414)
  <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/1414>`__. CodeGrade now supports
  SSO leveraging the SAML2.0 protocol, allowing even better integration.

**Updates**

- Use the same icons from the "Capture Points" AutoTest step for the "Unit
  Test" step `(#1403) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/1403>`__.
  The "Unit Test" step would always use the green checkmark if the step did not
  crash, but now the icon depends on the score achieved.
- Make the peer feedback counters for students more clear `(#1406)
  <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull 1406>`__. This changes the
  counters with the number of comments students have given to their peirs to be
  clearer and give more detailed information.
- Remove bin size "year" for the "Students submitted on" graph in the analytics
  dashboard `(#1407) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/1407>`__.
  The years option did not work very nicely because it didn't use the correct
  labels, and it is unclear what the start of a bin should be, so it has been
  removed as it isn't really useful in a context where an assignment takes less
  than a year.
- Add rate limiting to login route `(#1410)
  <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de>`__. Make it impossible to
  bruteforce someone's password by sending infinite requests to the login
  route.

Version Mosaic
---------------

**Released**: July 21st, 2020

With CodeGrade Peer Feedback it is now possible for students to review code of
other students, allowing them to learn from each other. Furthermore, it is even
easier to integrate existing unit tests in AutoTest, by utilizing the new "Unit
test" step type.

**Features**

- Add "Unit Test" AutoTest step `(#1385)
  <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/1385>`__. This new AutoTest
  step type supports all testing frameworks that can output their results the
  JUnit XML format. The results are shown to the student  in an intuitive
  overview.

  student submission, if it is available. `(#1390)
  <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/1390>`__.
- Allow test submissions before the deadline `(#1395)
  <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/1395>`__. This may be useful
  when setting up a course without knowing the deadline yet in LMSes that
  support deadline synchronization, for which impossible to change the deadline
  from within CodeGrade.
- Add Peer Feedback feature `(#1394)
  <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/1394>`__. When peer feedback
  is enabled for an assignment, students can give each other feedback after the
  deadline of an assignment has passed.

Version *LowVoltage.1*
----------------------

**Released**: June 10th, 2020

With our new Feedback Sidebar, you can now view all previous feedback from
a student in the course, while grading the current submission. It is now also
possible to get submission metadata in AutoTest, for instance to automate late
day penalties. Finally, we have upgraded CodeGrade to the newest version of
LTI: LTI 1.3 Advantage!

**Features**

- Course feedback `(#1342)
  <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/1335>`__. Adds an overview of
  all the feedback a student received over an entire course. Teachers have
  access to this overview on the submission page in the same location as the
  file tree. For students there is an extra button on the submissions page.
- Improve plagiarism document rendering `(#1335)
  <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/1335>`__. Matching blocks of
  code can now be rendered side by side, the amount of context lines before and
  after each match is configurable, and it is possible to export to a docx
  file.
- Add LTI 1.3 implementation `(#1277)
  <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/1277>`__. This makes the
  integration in the LMS even better, allowing better workflows for group
  assignments and easier assignment creation.
- Include submission information in AutoTest environment `(#1361)
  <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/1361>`__. Some information
  about a submission is now available in AutoTest as a JSON object that is
  stored in an environment variables. This is useful to automatically subtract
  points based on the submission date and deadline, or to generate a unique
  input for each submission or student.

**Updates**

- Remove "Add filter" button from analytics dashboard
  `(#1351) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/1351>`__.
  The button was confusing when splitting a filter, and since there already is
  another button to add new filters we removed it.
- Fix notification sorting order
  `(#1354) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/1354>`__. Unread
  notifications are now always sorted before read notifications.

Version 1.19.0 (Knoet.2)
-------------------------

**Released**: January 30th, 2020

You can now add Continuous Rubric Categories, which can score anywhere on a
continuous scale and work great with AutoTest. You can also now set student
submission limits and a cool off period.

**Features**

- Continuous rubric categories `(#1235)
  <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/1235>`__: this new type of
  rubric category can be used to give points anywhere on a scale from 0 to a
  configurable amount of points. This behavior maps better to certain types of
  AutoTest categories, such as categories containing only "capture points"
  steps. Rubrics can contain a mix of discrete and continuous categories and
  both can still be used for AutoTest.
- Make it possible to limit the amount of submissions `(#1237)
  <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/1237>`__: the amount of
  submissions can be limited in two ways:

  1. A maximum total amount of submissions for an assignment.
  2. A cool-off period: an amount of time a student must wait before they can
     submit again.
- Separate feedback permissions `(#1234)
  <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/1234>`__: the
  `can_see_grade_before_done` permission was used for all types of feedback
  students would get. New `can_see_user_feedback_before_done` and
  `can_see_linter_feedback_before_done` permissions make it possible to show
  these types of feedback before an assignment is set to done while still
  hiding others.

**Minor updates**

- Add warning when creating a wrong external tool link in Canvas `(#1248)
  <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/1248>`__: Canvas has multiple
  ways to integrate external tools, some of which leave CodeGrade unable to
  communicate correctly with it. This update displays a message when this
  happens.

**Fixes**

- Use the most privileged LTI role available
  `(#1248) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/1248>`__.
- Fix float matching for AutoTest capture points test
  `(#1251) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/1251>`__.

  for standalone courses, you can let users register via a unique URL. You can
  set this up on the Course Management Page.

**Minor updates**

- Update git instructions `(#1221) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/1221>`__:
  the git instructions have been updated to be more compatible with git GUIs. We've
  also added a button to the last step to check if submitting works correctly.
- Stop persisting access tokens in LTI `(#1216) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/1216>`__:

   AutoTest or Continuous Feedback more efficient by allowing multiple runners
   to work on one run.
-  Only show latest submissions by default
   `(#1040) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/1040>`__: make
   loading of submission(s) pages more efficient by only loading latest
   submissions by default, which especially is a problem with continuous
   feedback which can cause high amounts of attempts per student. Additionally
   adds an improved dropdown to switch between submissions of one student.

   no submission had an assignee and you assigned yourself it filtered
   all other submissions directly.
-  Make sure the grade is updated when rubric is.
   `(#731) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/731>`__
-  Improve worst case performance in some plagiarism cases.
   `(#732) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/732>`__

Version 1.0.22 (HereBeMonsters.2)
----------------------------------

**Released**: November 21st, 2018

**Features**

-  Enforce minimal password strength
   `(#683) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/683>`__
   `(#697) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/697>`__:
   CodeGrade now enforces a minimum password strength for all users. A
   warning is also shown if a user logs in with a password that doesn't
   adhere to the current requirements. We recommend all users to update
   their passwords if they receive such a warning.
-  Update course and assignment name on LTI launch
   `(#682) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/682>`__: If
   the name of a course or assignment changes within your LMS this
   change is now copied in CodeGrade.
-  Do lti launch on grade result
   `(#681) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/681>`__: When
   viewing new grades this will trigger an LTI launch. This means you
   will always be logged-in in CodeGrade with the current LMS user.
-  Show a loader instead of the delete button for plagiarism checks that
   are still running.
   `(#700) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/700>`__

**Fixes**

-  Only show register button when the feature is enabled.
   `(#679) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/679>`__
-  Make it possible to create PDF manuals.
   `(#687) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/687>`__
-  Fix plagiarism detail viewer
   `(#690) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/690>`__:
   Because of a misplaced bracket it was not possible to view plagiarism
   cases.
-  Always do an initial grade passback
   `(#692) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/692>`__: This
   reverts a change in version 1.0.0 which caused Canvas to not remove
   CodeGrade assignments from the todo list of students. By doing a LTI
   passback when students hand-in a submission the assignment should be
   removed from their todo list.
-  Various small logging fixes.
   `(#693) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/693>`__
-  Redact emails of other users
   `(#695) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/695>`__: This
   is a minor **breaking change**. When serializing a user an ``email``
   key was always sent including the email of every user. With this
   change the ``email`` key is only sent with the extended serialization
   of a user, and the value is changed to ``'<REDACTED>'`` for every
   user except the currently logged-in user. This prevents people in the
   same course from seeing each others email.
-  Improve speed of plagiarism route
   `(#694) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/694>`__: By
   using the database in a more efficient way this route should become
   about twice as fast!
-  Various styling fixes.
   `(#701) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/701>`__
   `(#703) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/703>`__

Version 1.0.7 (HereBeMonsters.1)
--------------------------------

**Released**: November 12th, 2018

**Features**

- Support files encoded as ISO-8859-1 (latin1) in the frontend.
  `(#666) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/666>`_

**Fixes**

- Make it impossible to override the special files of the CodeGrade
  filesystem. `(#673) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/673>`_
- Various frontend fixes. `(#664) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/664>`_ `(#669) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/669>`_ `(#671) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/671>`_ `(#674) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/674>`_
- Improve documentation. `(#672) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/672>`_

Version 1.0.0 (HereBeMonsters)
------------------------------

**Released**: October 30th, 2018

**Features**

-  Add Plagiarism checkers `(#486) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/486>`_ `(#513) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/513>`_ `(#536) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/536>`_ `(#555) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/555>`_ `(#508) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/508>`_ `(#556) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/556>`_
   `(#645) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/645>`_ `(#576) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/576>`_: It is now possible to check for plagiarism in
   CodeGrade. This enables privacy aware plagiarism checking. It is
   possible to use check against old CodeGrade assignment and upload
   base code and old submissions that are not in CodeGrade. For more
   information see our documentation.

-  Make it possible give grades higher than ten `(#500) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/500>`_: Teachers can now
   indicate that students can receive a grader higher than 10 for an
   assignment, making it possible to create assignments with bonus
   points in CodeGrade. When using within LTI this requires a new LTI
   parameter.

   You should add the following to the ``<blti:custom>`` section of your
   canvas LTI config for CodeGrade:

   .. code:: xml

      <lticm:property name="custom_canvas_points_possible">
        $Canvas.assignment.pointsPossible
      </lticm:property>

**Minor updates**

-  Change homepage to login screen `(#480) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/480>`_ `(#496) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/496>`_ `(#501) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/501>`_ `(#557) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/557>`_ `(#616) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/616>`_:
   The homepage has been improved to show all your courses and
   assignments at a glance when logged in.
-  Use new logos `(#481) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/481>`_ `(#506) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/506>`_: This updates our logo to the newest and
   greatest version!
-  Allow .tar.xz archives to be uploaded `(#492) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/492>`_: This further improves
   the flexibility CodeGrade gives students when handing in submissions.
-  Fix infinite loop overview mode `(#477) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/477>`_: In some combinations of
   permissions loading the overview mode resulted in an infinite loader.
-  Add general feedback tab to overview mode `(#523) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/523>`_: This further
   decreases the chance that students will miss any of their feedback.
-  Improve speed of diffing by using another library `(#529) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/529>`_: Viewing the
   diff between two large files is a lot faster!
-  Remove the option to automatically generate keys `(#554) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/554>`_: It is no
   longer possible to generate the ``secret_key`` or ``lti_secret_key``
   configuration options. Please update your config accordingly.
-  Rewrite snippets manager `(#551) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/551>`_: This rewrite should make creating,
   using, deleting and updating snippets faster and more reliable.
-  Drastically improve the experience of CodeGrade on mobile `(#558) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/558>`_: It
   is now way easier to use CodeGrade on mobile.
-  Filter users in the user selector `(#553) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/553>`_: When selecting users (when
   uploading for others, or adding to courses) only show users will be
   shown that can be selected.
-  Improve handling of LTI `(#561) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/561>`_ `(#588) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/588>`_: A complete rewrite of LTI
   backend handling. This should improve the stability of passbacks by a
   lot. This also guarantees that the submission date in Canvas and
   CodeGrade will match exactly. This also adds a new convenience route
   ``/api/v1/lti/?lms=Canvas`` to get lti config for the given LMS
   (Canvas only supported at the moment).
-  Add items to the sidebar conditionally `(#578) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/578>`_ `(#580) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/580>`_ `(#600) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/600>`_: Depending
   on what page you are you will get extra items in the sidebar to help
   quick navigation. Currently plagiarism cases and submissions are
   added depending on the page.
-  Start caching submissions `(#643) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/643>`_ `(#636) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/636>`_: Submissions are cached in the
   front-end so changing between the codeviewer and submissions list is
   now way quicker.
-  Ensure all rubric rows have a maximum amount of >= 0 points `(#579) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/579>`_: It
   is no longer allowed to have rows in a rubric where the maximum
   possible score is < 0. If you needed this to create rubrics with
   bonus categories simply use the ‘Max points’ option in the rubric
   editor. All existing rubrics are not changed.

**Fixes**

-  Various small bugs in the sidebar
-  Add a minimum duration on the permission manager loaders `(#521) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/521>`_: This
   makes it clearer that permissions are actually updated.
-  Throw an API error when a rubric row contains an empty header `(#535) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/535>`_:
   This is a backwards incompatible API change, however it doesn’t
   change anything for the frontend.
-  Fix broken matchFiles function `(#528) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/528>`_ `(#550) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/550>`_: This fixes a bug that
   files changed inside a directory would not show up in the overview
   mode.
-  Fix horizontal overflow on codeviewer `(#518) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/518>`_: The codeviewer would
   sometimes overflow creating a vertical scrollbar when displaying
   files containing a large amount of consecutive tabs.
-  Check if an assignment is loaded before getting its course `(#549) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/549>`_: In
   some rare cases LTI launches would fail be cause assignments were not
   loaded correctly.
-  Add structured logging setup `(#546) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/546>`_: This makes it easier to follow
   requests and debug issues.
-  Fix general feedback line wrapping `(#570) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/570>`_: Giving long lines as
   general feedback should be displayed correctly to the user now.
-  Add manage assignment button to submission list `(#574) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/574>`_: It is now
   possible to easily navigate to the manage assignment page from the
   submissions list.
-  Start using enum to store permissions in the backend `(#571) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/571>`_: Most
   routes will be faster by this design change.
-  Improve filetree design `(#599) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/599>`_ `(#611) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/611>`_ `(#587) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/587>`_: It is now easier to spot
   additions, changes and deletion directly in the filetree.
-  Add ``<noscript>`` tag `(#613) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/613>`_: An error message will be displayed when
   javascript is disabled.
-  Improve speed of filetree operations `(#623) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/623>`_: Loading large filetrees
   is now way quicker by using smarter data-structures.
-  Add health route `(#593) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/593>`_: It is now possible to more easily monitor the
   health of your CodeGrade instance.
-  Fix fontSize & contextAmount on submission page `(#633) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/633>`_: Sometimes the
   fields would show up empty, this shouldn’t happen anymore!
-  Replace submitted symlinks with actual files `(#627) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/627>`_: When a student
   uploads an archive with symlinks the student is warned and all
   symlinks are replaced by files explaining that the original files
   were symlinks but that those are not supported by CodeGrade.
-  Fix grade history popover boundary `(#625) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/625>`_: The grade history would
   sometimes show up outside the screen, but no more!
-  Make it impossible to submit empty archives `(#622) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/622>`_: A error is shown
   when a student tries to submit an archive without files.
-  Show toast when local-storage doesn’t work `(#607) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/607>`_: When a user has no
   local-storage available a warning is shown so the user knows that
   their experience might be sub-optimal.
-  Show author of general feedback and line comments `(#564) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/564>`_ `(#605) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/605>`_: The
   author of all general feedback and line comments is displayed to the
   user. Only users with the ``can_see_assignee`` permission will see
   authors.
-  Justify description popover text `(#596) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/596>`_: The text in descriptions is
   now justified and their popups will only show when the ‘i’ is
   clicked.
-  Only submit rubric items or normal grade `(#589) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/589>`_: In some rare cases
   overriding rubrics would result in a race condition, resulting in
   wrong case.
-  Redesign the download popover on the submission page `(#595) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/595>`_: This new
   design looks way better, but you tell us!
-  Only show overview mode when you have permission to see feedback
   `(#563) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/563>`_: When you don’t have permission to see feedback the overview
   mode will never be shown.
-  Various other performance improvements `(#566) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/566>`_: We always strive for
   the best performance possible, and again in this release we increased
   the performance of CodeGrade!
-  Make sure codeviewer is full width on medium pages `(#591) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/591>`_: This makes
   it easier to review and display code on smaller screens.
-  Use custom font in toasted actions `(#614) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/614>`_: It is now always possible
   to close toasts, even when your font cannot display ‘✖’.
